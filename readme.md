My first react project, making an expense app to track your expenses.

How to make this work?

1. Download and install node.js via https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Clone the repository
3. Run "npm install" in the project folder
4. Run "npm start" after installation

Terminal will automatically open the local page in your browser.
